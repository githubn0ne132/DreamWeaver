# DreamWeaver Agent Guide

- Use npm for dependency installation and scripts (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
- Keep TypeScript code strongly typed; prefer named exports and avoid introducing `any` unless justified.
- When changing behavior, update relevant docs (especially `README.md`) to match the user experience.
- Run `npm run build` before delivering changes and report the results in the final response.
- Keep formatting consistent with the existing code style; follow React/TypeScript conventions and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
